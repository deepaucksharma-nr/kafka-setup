- **New Simulator**: Deployed memory-optimized comprehensive simulator
  - Fixed OOMKilled issue by reducing memory footprint
  - Single Python process managing all simulation patterns
  - Creating 20+ topics with various configurations
  - Generating diverse producer/consumer patterns
  - Status: **Running stable**

### 2. New Relic Configuration âœ…
- **nri-kafka**: Optimized configuration applied
  - Using Zookeeper discovery (workaround for bootstrap bug)
  - Monitoring ALL topics and consumer groups
  - Dual-instance setup (30s broker, 15s consumer lag)
  - Status: **Collecting metrics successfully**

### 3. Metrics Collection Verified âœ…
Confirmed data flowing to New Relic:
- **KafkaBrokerSample**: âœ… Receiving broker metrics
- **KafkaTopicSample**: âœ… Topic metrics being collected
- **KafkaConsumerSample**: âœ… Consumer group lag monitoring active
- **QueueSample**: ðŸ”„ Ready for Share Group data

### 4. Dashboard & Queries Created âœ…
- **Dashboard JSON**: Created comprehensive 5-page dashboard
  - Broker Overview
  - Topics & Partitions
  - Consumer Groups
  - Share Groups (Future)
  - Infrastructure
- **Verification Queries**: Documented NRQL queries for validation
- **Import Guide**: Step-by-step dashboard import instructions

## Known Issues & Workarounds Applied

1. **nri-kafka Bootstrap Bug**
   - Issue: Integration defaulting to localhost:9092
   - Workaround: Using Zookeeper discovery
   - Status: âœ… Working

2. **Simulator OOM**
   - Issue: Original simulator consuming too much memory
   - Solution: Rewrote as single Python process
   - Status: âœ… Fixed

3. **Share Group Consumers**
   - Issue: Kafka 4.0 client not available
   - Status: Expected failure, monitoring infrastructure ready

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Import Dashboard**
   - Use new-relic-dashboard.json
   - Update accountId in queries
   - Customize as needed

2. **Set Up Alerts**
   - Under-replicated partitions > 0
   - Consumer lag > threshold
   - Disk usage > 80%

3. **Monitor Performance**
   - Watch for lag trends
   - Track throughput patterns
   - Analyze resource usage

## Summary

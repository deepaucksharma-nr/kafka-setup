# NRI-Kafka Deployment Status

## ‚úÖ Configuration Applied Successfully

The optimized nri-kafka configuration has been deployed with the following improvements:

### Configuration Changes Applied:
1. **Bootstrap Server Discovery**: Replaced deprecated Zookeeper with `kafka-0.kafka:9092`
2. **Topic Monitoring**: Set to `TOPIC_MODE: all` to monitor all topics
3. **Consumer Group Monitoring**: Enabled with `CONSUMER_GROUP_MODE: all`
4. **Dual Collection Instances**: 
   - Main instance: 30s interval for broker and topic metrics
   - Consumer lag instance: 15s interval for consumer group metrics only
5. **Performance Tuning**: Applied connection pooling and timeout settings

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ New Relic Infrastructure pod running
- ‚úÖ Configuration loaded correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è nri-kafka having connection issues (trying localhost:9092)
- ‚ùå Comprehensive simulator crashed (Python dependency issues)

## üîç Troubleshooting Connection Issue

The nri-kafka integration is experiencing a connection issue where it's trying to connect to `localhost:9092` instead of the configured `kafka-0.kafka:9092`. This appears to be a bug in nri-kafka v2.19.0 when using bootstrap discovery.

### Potential Solutions:

1. **Add explicit host mapping** (Quick fix):
```bash
kubectl exec -it newrelic-infrastructure-4ltsj -n kafka-monitoring -- sh -c "echo '127.0.0.1 kafka-0.kafka' >> /etc/hosts"
```

2. **Use IP address instead of hostname**:
```bash
# Get Kafka service IP
kubectl get svc kafka -n kafka-monitoring -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'
# Update BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS to use IP instead
```

3. **Revert to Zookeeper discovery** (Not recommended):
```yaml
AUTODISCOVER_STRATEGY: zookeeper
ZOOKEEPER_HOSTS: '[{"host": "zookeeper", "port": 2181}]'
```

## üìä Verification Steps

Once connection is fixed, verify with these NRQL queries:

```sql
-- Check topic count (should be 20+)
FROM KafkaTopicSample 
SELECT uniqueCount(topic) 
WHERE clusterName = 'kafka-k8s-cluster' 
SINCE 10 minutes ago

-- Check consumer groups (should be 10+)
FROM KafkaConsumerSample 
SELECT uniqueCount(consumerGroup) 
WHERE clusterName = 'kafka-k8s-cluster' 
SINCE 10 minutes ago

-- Check broker metrics
FROM KafkaBrokerSample 
SELECT latest(broker.messagesInPerSecond), latest(broker.bytesInPerSecond) 
WHERE clusterName = 'kafka-k8s-cluster' 
SINCE 10 minutes ago
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Fix nri-kafka connection**: Apply one of the solutions above
2. **Fix simulator**: Add Python dependencies or use simpler shell-based simulator
3. **Monitor data flow**: Check New Relic UI for incoming Kafka metrics
4. **Create dashboards**: Build comprehensive Kafka monitoring dashboards

## üìù Notes

- The configuration is correctly applied and will work once the connection issue is resolved
- The dual-instance approach ensures consumer lag is monitored more frequently (15s) than broker metrics (30s)
- All topics and consumer groups will be automatically discovered and monitored
